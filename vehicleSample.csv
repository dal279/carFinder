Extremely well-maintained. Bought as a certified used Mercedes. Adult owned never dragged or raced. I added a fully reversible Eurocharge stage 1 tune that bumps the torque from 479ft/lbs to an amazing 638ft/lbs which truly unleashes the beast in this vehicle. You‚Äôre in for a brutal and exhilarating acceleration. If you prefer it without the tune I can reverse it for you at no cost. I just installed brand new OEM Michelin tires in the rear with less than 15 miles on them. Original manual and two keys.Fully loaded. MSRP 144k. Driven less than 100 miles per month.

Reviews:  * Shop here if you need your SUV to carry up to eight passengers all of their stuff and tow up to 8300 pounds. Not only can you do all that but youll look good while doing it. Source: KBB.com  * Available seating for up to eight passengers; strong V8 power; stout towing capacity; quiet interior. Source: Edmunds  * The well-recognized Escalade has been among the Kings of the SUV family for years. For 2015 the much loved SUV has been revamped and upgraded. The classic eye-catching look of the Escalade remains unchanged riding high on it's traditional body-frame. But for some it's on what's on the inside that counts. The all new interior is wrapped in a wealth of perforated leather prominent stitching and genuine wood while tiered surfaces demonstrate a level of detail and craftsmanship unmatched in previous generations. The dash and instrument panel are anchored by the flashy CUE multimedia system and its 8-inch touchscreen interface. CUE uses proximity sensors to activate common options and controls as the user's hand approaches. Opt for the larger 12.3in and embrace the HD graphics. The front and rear ends use steeply stacked vertical layouts for the standard LED headlights and taillights and Cadillac's grille design is presented in its largest form yet. The Escalade also carries over a 6.2-liter V8 this one comes from the latest generation of direct-injection engines with output increased to 420HP and 460 lb-ft of torque. This combination combusts in a freight train-like pull when you hit the throttle. The base rear-wheel-drive Escalade can tow up to 8200 pounds  making it useful for those who aren't afraid to get a little dirty. Escalade's new technologies include safety features to help protect occupants at all times; front and rear automatic braking relies short-range radar technology and ultrasonic sensors to help avoid front and rear low-speed collisions. Driver Awareness packages include Forward Collision Alert Lane Departure Warning System and the patented Safety Alert Seat which uses directional vibrations to alert the driver to potential crash threats.

Onyx Black 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 SLE RWD 6-Speed Automatic Electronic with Overdrive EcoTec3 4.3L V6 Flex Fuel  Awards:   * 2014 KBB.com Brand Image Awards Come see your friends today at Patriot CDJR in McAlester, OK! Visit our online showroom at   today!  Reviews:   * New, more fuel-efficient engines; improved interior; quiet highway ride. Source: Edmunds   * The 2014 Sierras innovative powertrains and handsome aesthetics should appeal to longtime GMC fans and tempt buyers new to the brand. In just one of many mine is bigger battles in the half-ton truck market, the 2014 Sierras 12,000-pound max tow rating is expected to be king  at least for now. Source: KBB.com   * The 2014 GMC Sierra 1500 is all new for 2014. It possesses chiseled features and distinct lines that not only make it look imposing, but increase how aerodynamic it is as well. In front, between the projector beam headlights, there is an incredibly striking and enormous chrome grille. While driving, it takes in a large portion of the air for cooling the engine, and lets the remainder glide across the truck. It is complimented by a bumper made of sculpted steel, a strong angled hood, and bulging fender flares. The changes made to the truck body, and the resulting improvements in air flow, add up to a quieter cabin for you and your passengers. Plus, its new hydraulic body mounts help mitigate vibrations to give you a smoother and more comfortable ride. Open the doors and the Sierra's interior welcomes you into a calming and comfortable retreat from the busy outside world. The seats utilize a new design for lasting comfort, and reduced fatigue. On select models, the instrument panel incorporates a high-end soft feel, combined with trim made of aluminum for an overall look that is very stylish. The instrument panel has been laid out in such a way that your controls are now easier to get to and see, with larger buttons and knobs, which are more convenient to grab. Spoil yourself with the available 8-inch IntelliLink touch-screen system that you can opt for on SLE and SLT trims. It lets you control your radio and make calls hands-free, wirelessly stream music from your phone, use the rear view camera, and operate the navigation system. Base Level Sierra trims on all models come with a powerful 4.3-Liter V6 EcoTech3 Engine with 285 horsepower and a 6-speed automatic transmission. You have the choice between the Crew Cab, Double Cab, and Regular Cab, and all except the Double Cab give you the option of two different box sizes. Plus, since you have the choice between two to three trims based on the model picked, GMC has a 2014 Sierra 1500 for just about anyone.

I will try to make the explanation of the service history as simple as possible. Since the time this car was new, it has been serviced at the Subaru Dealer, and serviced exactly as recommended by Subaru. Every minor and major service has been done, spot on, with absolutely no services skipped or missed and absolutely no gaps in the service history. You will not find a more thorough service history, and I have the entire 21 page service history from the local Subaru Dealer to go with the car.  It has been serviced a total of 34 times, which means that the car has been serviced an average of every 2,100 miles since new. (Subaru recommends service on this car every 3,750 miles). Vehicle was just serviced at the Subaru Dealer about 600 miles ago and got everything that they recommended, which included a new muffler, wiper blades, full synthetic oil change and VT State Inspection, which is now good though 12/31/21. This Forester also got new front brakes about 3,000 miles ago, and new spark plugs as part of the 60k mile major service, which was completed less than 10k miles ago.  Additionally, the car has 4 like new Nokian Hakkapeliitta R3 winter tires on it now. Starting in 2011, Subaru started using the updated triple layer steel head gaskets that never require replacement, and they switched the engine design from a timing belt to a timing chain, which has no recommended maintenance or replacement. This Forester runs and drives great, no ""problem lights"" on, vehicle has great power, shifts smoothly, sounds and feels tight over bumps, goes down the road straight with no shaking or pulling, brake pedal is high and tight with no shaking or squeaking, interior cabin is very quiet even at highway speeds, ride is very smooth, all options work, everything is very tight, and fuel economy is excellent for an all wheel drive vehicle. Clean title in hand, clean Carfax report, 1 owner, and no accidents.  Vehicle comes with all 3 original keys; two keys with built in buttons for factory alarm/keyless entry/panic/trunk release, plus a valet key, and the owner's manual and all related literature in the original Subaru leather pouch. This Forester is priced $1,000 below NADA retail or ""high book value,"" and it goes well beyond meeting the description of what a vehicle should be, condition wise and mechanically, to deserve high book value; price is currently firm. This car is truly the exception to the rule condition-wise.  If you put this car in a showroom and put the original window sticker back in it, most folks walking by wouldn't even notice that it wasn't new.  Current odometer reading is 70,678.  Please call or text 802-279-8418 or email with any questions.

Bought from ‚ÄúONE OWNER‚Äù 3 months ago. Here‚Äôs the back story. I ordered me a brand new Sports car in November but was told It would not built and delivered until about November 2021, which was fine. So I wanted a sports car to drive until my new car gets built this year. Well‚Ä¶..the dealer contacted me in Feb and stated my allocation came in and my new car will now be built in approximately 60-90 days as long as there are no other issues with the parts supplier. Bottom line I must sale now to prepare for my new car. This infiniti is in awesome condition and has been well taken care of and loaded with 6 speed transmission, power everything, including navigation, and sunroof. Only have 113,600 miles (miles will go up), new tires, enterior mint condition, window sticker, all Owners manuals and books still in plastic. Some clear coat peeling off mirrors, antenna, and door handles (can be repainted for about $350) and small scuff on left side rear that need touched up. It is well worth the asking price of $11,999. I am not looking to trade but if you have something that‚Äôs equal to my asking price of my Infiniti and its a non-sports coupe I might entertain but prefer to Sale outright.  Possible muscle car, 4 dr sports sedan, etc... The car is now located at the for sale lot on Fort Gordon, Georgia. Call with questions!",,ga,33.413,-82.1337,2021-04-14T07:00:52-0400

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

Vehicle also has a tow hitch! great feature to have on an SUV.  This vehicle was in service and recently retired from the road due to departments scheduled upgrade to new vehicles.  The only thing I had to do was put brand new tires on less then 500 miles ago. These are the Goodyear Eagle Enforcer all season pursuit rated tires, over $240 each tire installed this month at Mavis in Flanders. I have receipts.  Vehicle has no issues and runs flawlessly. While the tires were being installed, the brakes were inspected and they still had 80% brake life life on them.  Vehicle is ready for service (police or security) or ready for a personal buyer who is looking for a great daily driver that gets a lot of respect on the road.  Asking price is $17.5k. Do not contact me with low ball offers, I am in no rush to sell.",,nj,40.8453,-74.7019,2021-04-11T20:18:58-0400

We also hand pick our trucks and suvs from a rust free environment. So 1-2 years down the road you're not wishing you'd never seen that rusty truck. Something we strive to avoid. We pay more for the non-rusty vehicles so your not stuck with costly rust repairs. Not only the repairs you can see but the ones you can't. which include things like brakes, exhaust, frame rot, bed support rot and the one thing that cost you more in the long run, the things that nobody really hears about.... its when you take your truck in for a repair of any kind and the mechanic has to spend hours fighting the rusty bolts and brackets that have fused themselves together. This will definitely cost you money. Why you ask?? Because time and more importantly mechanic frustration cost you money!!

Got it in a trade with the intention of fixing it up as a daily but haven't had time. I have a replacement door for the passenger side that will come with the car. I put a new alternator and oil pump on it but it's still showing low oil pressure once it warms up.  The engine does knock briefly on start-up as well. The cylinder bores, rods, and pistons looked okay from the underside when I was replacing the oil pump & didn't seem to have play but I haven't had time to diagnose further.   It will run & drive under its own power but should probably be trailered if you're going far.  900 bucks OBO, just need it gone. May trade for freedom seeds or other items in that category.

The car has been produced through seven generations. The first model, a convertible, was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1953 as a concept show car. Myron Scott is credited for naming the car after the type of small, maneuverable warship called a corvette. Originally built in Flint, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri, the Corvette is currently manufactured in Bowling Green, Kentucky and is the official sports car of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Think of the Corvette Z06 as the most amazing version of a sports car that is already amazing by anyone's measure. Sold as either a coupe or convertible, the most important feature is its supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 that makes 650 hp and 650 lb-ft. A seven-speed manual is on hand for shifting duties, and an eight-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters is now available.Cherry City Auto Sales is pleased to present this gorgeous 2016 Chevrolet Corvette Z06. Coming in a Torch Red with a black power convertible top and an Adrenaline Red interior with the 2LZ equipment which includes memory package, power heated outside mirrors, heated and ventilated seats, and premium audio with surround sound. The owner also went ahead and had the performance data and video recorder with navigation. The engine in this car is the Chevy LT4 6.2L supercharged V8, with the added 8-speed paddle shifting automatic transmission. The Z06 performance package includes the Z06 performance suspension, magnetic ride control, slotted brake rotors, dry sump oil system, electronic limited slip differential, z06 pearl nickel 19'' front and 20'' aluminum wheels, multi-mode performance exhaust. Chevy did not hold back when it came to the new Z06 and this low mileage example is one that cannot be passed up, or passed on the track! ‚úÖ Call or Text us Today üì±(503) 382-8806 ‚úÖ For more info on this vehicle please copy and paste the link below in your url:https://leadstrap.com/3vt09PN‚úÖ To get pre-approved for this vehicle please copy and paste the link below in your url:https://leadstrap.com/3vrBlHB****   We Offer Military Discount *******Se Habla Esp√£nol*** ‚úÖ Shipping all over the States! ‚úÖ  Vehicle comes in sealed container! ‚úÖ  7 Days inspection period from the moment of delivery! ‚úÖ  Fast delivery in 6 days! ‚úÖ  Call to get quote on shipping!!!‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ CALL OR TEXT US üì± (503) 382-8806 ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπCherry Auto Sales‚úÖ Address üìç: 1090 12th St SE ‚úÖ Phone üì±: (503) 382-8806 ‚úÖ For more info on this vehicle please copy and paste the link below in your url:https://leadstrap.com/3vt09PN‚úÖ To get pre-approved for this vehicle please copy and paste the link below in your url:https://leadstrap.com/3vrBlHBüåê To view our entire inventory, go to:  www.shopcherryauto.com/?utm_source=AutoLink&utm_medium=Craigslist&utm_campaign=Craigslist%20Ads‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ Call or Text us Today üì± (503) 382-8806 ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπ‚úπTEXT/SMS: Please text your message to the seller to (503) 382-8806 now for quick answers!Call or Text us Today (503) 382-8806 for quick answers to your questions about this Chevrolet Corvette 2LZ Z06.***** Chevrolet Corvette 2LZ Z06*****Call or Text us Today (503) 382-8806 TEXT/SMS: Please text your message to the seller to (503) 382-8806 now for quick answers!Disclaimer : Call or Text us Today (503) 382-8806 for quick answers to your questions about this 2016 Chevrolet Corvette 2LZ Z06*Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet* *Corvette_2LZ Z06*2016 Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet 8 cylinders Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet fwd Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet automatic Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet 2LZ Z06 Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet Chevrolet Corvette Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet 6.2 Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet 2-door Chevrolet_Chevrolet_Chevrolet",,wi,44.927304,-123.030322,2021-04-27T15:07:07-0500

The Sable is Able, or at least she has been for me.136,020 miles so pretty low! I purchased this car last March from a single owned family(I believe it belonged to a great aunt and then sold to her niece for their family car). I have every service record since it was purchased. Including mine from the last year. Oil changes have never missed a beat I think it's a pretty solid car, did GREAT on the ice and the sound system is pretty great for a stock one if that is your sort of jam. It has a ""mature"" body frame(it is a mercury).  City 18/Hwy 28/Comb 22 MPG and she really shines for long drives, roomy for a sedan and has a sunroof. It was produced as a luxury vehicle and rides like one, probably the most comfortable car I've driven in.   Why am I selling it? Great question, I adopted two GIANT Great Pyrenees(one is bigger than me) and this just isn't the car for us. I need to upgrade to the van life. For your next question-yes-dogs and children have been in the vehicle. In the process of detailing it so it should be nice and shiny for you.   What have I replaced-brakes(lifetime warranty from Midas) and defrost. Occasionally if you don't screw the gas cap on the emissions light will come up. Talked to my mechanic and nothing to worry about, if it bugs you it is a $100 fix. Hasn't been on in a few months but worth mentioning. Transmission, ac/heater, alignment all good to go.   It's a 2008  but it's been treated well so anything in the past looks like it was fixed right away. The other thing worth mentioning is the driver heated seat doesn't want to turn on. It's an electrical thing so I'm sure you could YouTube for pay the $100 if it's something you NEED. Again-this car is from 2008 so it does have normal wear and tear but I still think she looks shiny. Wheels have some life in them as well.  Price $4500 or a reasonable offer. Before you come at me with a ridiculously low offer please compare other vehicles of this value/age/mileage/etc. I'm not in a rush.

Frequently Asked Questions 1.) Q: Business hours? A: Monday - Saturday 9 am to 6:00 pm and Closed on Sundays. 2.) Q: What are my payment options? A: CASH, CREDIT CARD (with 3% fee), DEBIT CARD (with 1% fee) and CASHIER'S CHECK. Please note: we do not accept PERSONAL CHECKS. 3.) Q: Do we finance? A: We do not directly finance (we do not offer buy here, pay here). Our cars are discounted, because we primarily do cash deals. 4.) Q: Do we take trades? A: Yes, we must see the car in person and depending on the car's condition and if we agree on price we can do a trade. *Please note: the car must be free and clear, we will not purchase a car without a title. 5.) Q: Can out-of-state buyer's purchase a car? A: Yes, you must have a valid u.s. driver's license and valid car insurance to purchase a car. 6.) Q: How much to purchase a car? From PA or out of state. A: PA buyers will pay the car cost, plus tag and title which is $195 with a new plate ($155 with your own plate) plus sales tax, can change without notice. ***Out of state buyers $100 in-transit plate which gives you 60 days to drive the car and register it within that period. 7.) Q: Is there a warranty? A: We sell all our cars as-is and recommend you change the car fully for yourselves. Yes, you have the ability to buy a warranty when pricing a $3500 and higher priced car. You can purchase a warranty on a monthly, quarterly, yearly basis with more options up to five years. For pricing, please contact the dealer for more information. 8.) Q: Can I purchase a car without visiting the dealership via car shipping? A: Yes, with the correct documentation and additional transporting costs. Please ask the dealer for more information. 9.) Q: What if I do not have car insurance? A: You will need to purchase insurance and we can help with that for no extra cost. 10.) Q: Do we get our vehicles mechanically checked? A: Yes, every car is checked multiple times (unless it just came to the lot) and we still recommend checking every car for yourselves. Please bring your own mechanics to the lot and have them check the car in full for you. Each car has 30,000 parts and buying a used car you need to treat each car with respect, quarterly maintenance, detailing them, and drive it with the speed limits in mind. When you take care of your car it will take care of you, because it's a piece of machinery that takes you safely from point a to point b on a daily basis.",,pa,40.616946,-75.441782,2021-04-30T08:58:23-0400

This car was a gift to husbend , he used it to do highway driving when going on gigs ( musician )  Its sat in garage under car cover. No winter driving. 55,000 miles left on Bumper to Bumper.  Its good as new. Can't usually find them like this! :)  I'm happy to send referrals/ notes from past customers.  So that you have more than one convenient way to potentially purchase this car. I briefly explain my free delivery routine below. I realize the knee jerk reaction is usually "" no way "". However after learning about it , about 80 percent of my customers choose to take advantage of it. Big car companies are starting to use , what I have been doing since 2006.  ~~~~~~~ I hope you are interested in the vehicle in this ad.... If not... or if I have sold this car , I‚Äôm happy to try and find another. The link below should show SOME of my current inventory Many times I sell cars without having to list them online. Feel free to text or email me with a price range etc.  ~~~~~~~~ I also help people sell any type of Vehicle/ Classics / RV / Motorcycle / Trailer / Equipment. I have been commended for making it hassle free. I find a buyer, qualify them, and cut you a check. Ask me to mail you some business cards. I am happy to $end thank you to people who refer me to successful ventures.  ~~~~~~~ My inventory is available for tv and film productions. I have on set experience including driving for difficult helicopter shots. I have picture car , location scout experience, and enjoy a challenge in attempting to locate rare vehicles. Also looking for rare cars/ boats etc. owned by interesting people for a TV show project. If you know of anyone. Please reach out.  ~~~~~~~~~~  OPTIONAL DELIVERY SERVICE FREE in New England / NY. Unless you are located more than 8 hours away from central MA etc. A great many car buyers enjoy that I provide an option that provides relief from dealership shopping. Others find themselves in a pinch after and accident or breakdown. I often deliver cars purchased by out of USA parents to their children enrolled in New England / New York/ Cape / Island and universities.  My usual requirement of asking for a small non refundable deposit before I arrange delivery is primarily to filter out the ‚Äú tire kickers‚Äù or the people who are looking for company for a Sunday drive. I need to have some good faith skin into the game before I free up my dealer plate and pay 2 people ( chase car) to bring the car to your door. I‚Äôve delivered hundreds of cars and never had one turned away.  TEST DRIVE the car when it arrives. If the car arrives not as described , YOU DON't over the payment.  ~ re: delivery please include your zip code and info on any old vehicle your looking to get rid of ( that could make the ride back to MA if need be.) If your old car has value ( most need more repairs than value ) I can sell it on consignment. Often it's convenient for you to use the plates from your old car and transfer registration.  A FYI , You do not have to pay for the car before hand. Once you show interest in a particular car I‚Äôm going to let you know my thoughts on it. Each deal has unique aspects, so I‚Äôm unable to cover everything here.   Thanks for the interest! ~ Steve Woods Text / Cell 508-523-2123",,ma,42.265589,-71.837311,2021-04-17T17:31:20-0400

It has never been in an accident. All the panels are still original to this date. Owned only in the south. It has no mechanical issues, no leaks at all. There are a few dings and scratches here and there but nothing serious. I have the AutoCheck from Experian. I can email it if you are interested in. It was driven less than 7000 miles a year with 148XXX miles on the odometer. Battery is 1 year old. A/C blows cold. It will probably need new tires but that‚Äôs about it.

It's got some rust on the fenders and the underbody. At the moment it is in limp mode. It runs but, rough because the EPC light is on. It's throwing quite a few codes. This happened one day about 3 months ago on my way to work. I haven't had the time to mess with it - thought I'd wait till the snow was gone since I don't have a garage. Snow's gone but I find now I don't want to deal with it.  Before the EPC light came on the Check Engine light had been on since 2017. Took it to VW in Barre and they gave me a list of things from their scanner. Fixed all those things but the light stayed on. Replaced the low pressure fuel pump. Light still on. Replaced the in-line fuel filter/regulator. Light stayed on. Ran 2 cans of CRC valve cleaner thru the intake manifold to clean some of the crap off the top of the valves from that absolutely stupid PCV system. Light stayed on. Was going to replace the low pressure sensor on the high pressure pump next. Then the EPC light came on and I stopped driving it. The hood release latch broke and the cable to the mechanism is gone. I ripped it out because it had completely rusted out.  A lot of other things have been done prior to all that: Complete front suspension replacement. Total brake job. Timing belt replacement. New front windshield. With a little love and patience this car would be okay to drive for a few more years. Or you could use it as a parts car.  Call me if you are interested.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

More information about the 2017 Toyota Prius: One of the most remarkable things about the Prius is how little it asks from the owner in exchange for its legendary fuel efficiency. Special fuel isn't needed, and there's no need to plug the standard Prius into the wall at night. Further, drivers are not consigned to a tiny interior and miniature storage space, and finally, premium mileage numbers don't have to cost an arm and a leg. The Prius drives, handles and behaves just like any other mid-sized car. It just happens to get the kind of fuel economy that can impress almost anyone. Starting at around $25,000 the Prius is competitive with other cars in its price bracket, offering ample interior space, a quiet comfortable ride, plenty of interior gadgets and world-famous mileage figures. With the all-new Prius Prime plug-in's range of up to 600 miles means there's nowhere that can't be gotten in a Prius. This model sets itself apart with plug-in option, Fuel economy, quiet interior, sharp styling, excellent interior room, and reasonable price    Kendall Toyota of Anchorage‚òé 877-602-12906930 Old Seward HwyAnchorage, AK 99518  ¬†Call us today at 877-602-1290Or use the link below to view more information!

Yukon XL is more SUV than most people need. But for those who truly need it, you can't beat it. Yukon XL is an upscale version of the Chevy Suburban. It's a well-equipped vehicle and a good choice for families of six or more. It offers comfortable seating for six people and can be equipped to seat up to nine, with nearly enough room to carry that many on a daily basis. Even when fully loaded with people, there's space left over for large amounts of gear. Safety features abound. Four-wheel discs with ABS and dynamic brake proportioning promise good braking performance under all conditions and regardless of load. Hydroboost brakes provide power assist even if the engine stalls. Dual-stage frontal airbags are standard, of course, and side-impact airbags are available. Yukon XL comes with a tire-pressure monitor.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.

This Toyota Prime is not a classic, but, it is very rare with my understanding there is IN Sum cities a list as long as 2 years. This Prime belongs to a family member and they really love it. The best they have ever owned. HOWEVER; their needs are for a truck. The Prime just is not a truck. This again is very rare, this low mileage, only 12,276 as of this photo shoot. The alloy wheel were taken off and were powder coated in a matching glossy black matching the fender flares. These wheels look a lot better then the splitter silver look the factory provides. This PRIME will be going on ebay Monday evening.

If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.			 						 			 This post is almost 30 days old. Surely you don't still have this vehicle, do you?			 						 			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.			 						 			You say you help people with less than perfect credit, are you a Buy Here - Pay Here lot?			 						 			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.			 						 			Can I really secure financing with zero down payment?			 						 			Many customers actually take delivery 			 			without a checkbook or credit card.			 			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.			 						 			 Do you take trade-ins?			 						 			Yes.			 			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.			 						 			What if I want to trade in my vehicle but still owe more than it's worth.			 						 			This is another very common situation that usually 			 			 won't 			 			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.			 						 			 Are you guys really 1price? Won't you negotiate?			 						 			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.			 						 			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.			 						 			So, I like this vehicle I'm looking at, but I'd rather not talk to anyone yet. What do I do?			 						 			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.			 						 			 I think this vehicle might be the one for me, but I live several hours away. Can I prevent someone else from buying it before I get there?			 						 			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.			 						Accessories & color may vary. Dealer not responsible for errors or omissions.
